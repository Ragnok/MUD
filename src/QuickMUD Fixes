Fix 0 [MAKEFILE]

Modified compiler to place 'rom' binary into 'area' folder directly.
By default, the 'rom' binary can only work only in the 'area' directory, but was generated inside the 'src' directory.


Fix 1 [COMM.C]

Error Message: 
(didn't copy) Problem involved incorrect variable type

Solution: Used proper return type socklen_t for size variable


Fix 2 [ACT_WIZ.C]

Error Message: 
act_wiz.c:4616: warning: ignoring return value of ‘fscanf’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result

Solution: made use of fscanf return value

Changed %d to %ld

Solution:

Removed the boolean check in the if statement (in the majority of the warnings)
imc.c:2026: Changed boolean check to cwho[0] == '\0'
imc.c:5407: made use of fscanf return value


Fix 5 [STRING.C]

Error Message:
string.c:648: error: conflicting types for ‘getline’
/usr/include/stdio.h:651: note: previous declaration of ‘getline’ was here
make: *** [obj/string.o] Error 1

Solution:
string.c:648: renamed getline to merc_getline
string.c:687: renamed previous use of getline to merc_getline


Fix 6 [SCAN command]

Problem:
The SCAN command was not available to the player

Solution:
Added SCAN to interp.c as one of the available commands, the source already contained scan.c, it just didn't use it.
